## Note

---

Run `/function iif:toggle` to toggle the datapack on/off. The datapack is off by default.

To uninstall, run `/function iif:uninstall` first before removing the datapack.

## How To Use

---

1. Obtain a stick.
2. Rename the stick to `invisible` or `Invisible`.
3. Put the stick on the item frame. The item frame will turn invisible and you will get the stick back.
