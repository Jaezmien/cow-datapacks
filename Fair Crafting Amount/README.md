# Fair Crafting Amount

> Change the amount of blocks you get in a recipe

</center>

## What does it contain?

---

This recipe tweak contains [Vanilla Tweak's More Blocks](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/crafting-tweaks/) pack but with different values on certain packs.

-   `More Trapdoors` (Nerfed the amount you get to 8 instead of Minecraft's 2 and VanillaTweak's 12)
-   `More Bark`
-   `More Stairs` ([See below](#nerfing-more-stairs))
-   `More Bricks`

## Nerfing **More Stairs**

---

`More Stairs` is a debatable one.

Initially, Minecraft has the crafting recipe giving you 4 stairs for 6 blocks. In Vanilla Tweaks however, this is changed to 8 stairs, which is consistent with the sizes of each blocks. This introduces a big buff to the Crafting Table, since the Stonecutter makes 6 stairs for 6 stone blocks, making the Stonecutter entirely useless.

My decision is to only buff only certain recipes, **making planks give you 6 stairs, and keeping the amount you get with stone blocks.** Lore-wise, you can chalk it up to _"It's slightly difficult to cut stone in a Crafting Table instead of a Stonecutter"_ and ignore any holes in that reason.
